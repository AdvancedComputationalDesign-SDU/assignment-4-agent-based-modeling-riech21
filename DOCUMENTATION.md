## Pseudo-Code

1. **Class: `windparticle`**
- Represents a single particle.
- **Attributes**
  - `position`: Current position of the particle.
  - `velocity`: Current velocity vector.
  - `interaction_range`: Distance within which the particle interacts with the facade.
  - `attraction_strength`: Magnitude of attraction to the target point.
  - `trail`: List storing the particle's path.
- **Methods**
  - `move()`
    - Update `position` by adding `velocity`.
    - Append the updated `position` to the `trail`.
    - Ensure `velocity.X` remains positive.
  - `interact(facade)`
    - Find the closest point on the facade to the particle.
    - If within `interaction_range`, adjust `position` to push away from the facade.
    - Update `velocity` to smooth movement around the facade.
  - `attract_to_target(target)`
    - Calculate direction to the `target` point.
    - Adjust `velocity` to balance current direction and attraction.
    - Ensure `velocity.X` remains positive.
  - `get_trail_curve()`
    - Return `trail` as a curve object.
2. **Class: `Facade`**
- Represents a rectangular obstacle.
- **Attributes**
  - `base_point`: Bottom-left corner of the facade.
  - `width`, `height`: Dimensions of the facade.
  - `geometry`: Geometric representation of the facade.
- **Methods**
  - `closest_point(point)`
    - Calculate the closest point on the facade to the given `point`.
3. **Class: `Environment`**
- Simulates the interaction of particles within a bounded area.
- **Attributes**
  - `bounds`: Bounding box for the simulation.
  - `facade`: A single `Facade` object.
  - `particles`: List of `WindParticle` objects.
  - `attraction_target`: Target point for particle attraction.
- **Methods**
  - `generate_particles(num_particles)`
    - Create `num_particles` with random positions and uniform velocities.
    - Return the list of particles.
  - `update()`
    - For each particle
      - Call `move()`.
      - Call `interact(facade)`.
      - Call `attract_to_target(attraction_target)`.
      - Clamp the particle's position within `bounds`.
  - `clamp_particle_position(particle)`
    - Restrict the particleâ€™s position to stay within the `bounds`.

**Initialization and Execution**
1. **Environment Setup**
- Define `bounding_box` to set simulation limits.
- Initialize a `Facade` object with specific dimensions.
- Initialize the `Environment` with
  - `bounding_box`.
  - Specified `num_particles`.
2. **Simulation Update Loop**
- Call `env.update()` to
  - Move particles.
  - Handle interactions with the facade.
  - Attract particles to the target point.
3. **Outputs**
- Particle positions.
- Facade geometry.
- Bounding box.
- Target point.
- Particle trails as curves.
